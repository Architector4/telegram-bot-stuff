# telegram-bot-stuff
Some stuff of my Telegram bots, written in Rust with the
[Teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) library.

## arch_bot_commons

A crate of common functions; so far it's just a
"start logging and run the closure" function lol

## anti_nft_spam_bot

The code of [@Anti_NFT_Spam_Bot](https://t.me/Anti_NFT_Spam_Bot).
This bot is made to combat the currently ongoing wave of
NFT scam spam experienced by Telegram chats with linked channels.
DM it for instructions.

It's not fully done yet, but it's functional enough to catch most of it.

Current profile picture is taken from one of the scam websites
and edited to be crossed out.

## hi_cutie_bot

The code of [@hi_cutie_bot](https://t.me/hi_cutie_bot).
This bot is a cryptographically secure<sup>(citation needed)</sup>
password generator, [activated by a phrase of "Hi, cutie~"
](https://twitter.com/traexecutive/status/1424809156297568257)
if seen by the bot in direct messages or in a group chat it is in.

It can also be used inline, and produces a different response
activated by the phrase "Hi Herbert!".

Current profile picture is from here: https://www.extremelyfungible.com/vivi-heads

that could be of use. Under development.
