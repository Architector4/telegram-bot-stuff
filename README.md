# telegram-bot-stuff
Some stuff of my Telegram bots, written in Rust with the
[Teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) library.

## arch_bot_commons

A crate of common functions; so far it's just a
"start logging and run the closure" function lol

## hi_cutie_bot

The code of [@hi_cutie_bot](https://t.me/hi_cutie_bot).
This bot is a cryptographically secure<sup>(citation needed)</sup>
password generator, [activated by a phrase of "Hi, cutie~"
](https://twitter.com/traexecutive/status/1424809156297568257)
if seen by the bot in direct messages or in a group chat it is in.

It can also be used inline, and produces a different response
activated by the phrase "Hi Herbert!".
